# End to End Youtube Data Analysis Project
## Description
This project focuses on effectively handling, optimizing, and conducting in-depth analysis on YouTube video data, taking into account the video categories and trending indicators. The primary goal is to ensure the secure management and seamless processing of both structured and semi-structured YouTube video data, enabling valuable insights and actionable information to be derived.

By implementing robust methodologies, this project aims to streamline the entire data pipeline, encompassing data ingestion, transformation, and storage. The data will be carefully organized based on video categories, allowing for efficient retrieval and analysis. Additionally, the trending metrics associated with each video will be closely examined to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations.

Through the utilization of advanced analytics techniques, this project seeks to extract meaningful insights from the vast amount of YouTube video data. By applying data mining, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms, we aim to uncover valuable information about viewership, engagement, and user preferences. These insights can then be utilized to drive informed decision-making, content optimization, and audience targeting strategies.

Furthermore, data security and privacy will be given utmost importance throughout the project. Measures will be implemented to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data, adhering to industry best practices and compliance regulations. By establishing a secure environment, stakeholders can have confidence in the protection of sensitive information and maintain the trust of their users.

In summary, this project endeavors to create a secure, streamlined, and analytically-driven ecosystem for managing and analyzing YouTube video data. By considering video categories and trending metrics, we aim to unlock valuable insights and empower organizations to make data-driven decisions, optimize their content strategies, and enhance their overall YouTube presence.

## Project Goals
1. Data Ingestion — Build a mechanism to ingest data from different sources
2. ETL System — We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format
3. Data lake — We will be getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo to store them
4. Scalability — As the size of our data increases, we need to make sure our system scales with it
5. Cloud — We can’t process vast amounts of data on our local computer so we need to use the cloud, in this case, we will use AWS
6. Reporting — Build a dashboard to get answers to the question we asked earlier

## Services used
- Amazon S3, AWS IAM, QuickSight, AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, AWS Athena
